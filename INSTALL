YETI INSTALLATION NOTES
-----------------------

YETI is a Django web application that can be installed and run via several different methods.
The recommended way to easily stand up and use YETI is via the quickstart script located in
the scripts directory.

Quickstart
----------
To install and run YETI, users can take advantage of the quickstart script found within the
scripts directory of your YETI base directory. The quickstart.sh script is intended to be run
within Linux or OSX environments, while the quickstart.bat script can be run within a Windows
environemnt. To start YETI, follow these steps:

1) In a shell, navigate to the your YETI base directory
2) Run the quickstart script (quickstart.sh in Linux/OSX or quickstart.bat in Windows)
   
   ./scripts/quickstart.sh # on Linux/OSX
   scripts\quickstart.bat # on Windows
   
3) Type "yes" and press Enter when prompted to create a superuser account
4) Enter a username when prompted
5) Enter an email address when prompted
6) Enter a password when prompted
7) Enter password again when prompted
8) Open a web browser and enter 127.0.0.1 in the URL bar

You should be presented with a YETI welcome page that details the available services of your
YETI installation. Once YETI is running, you can interact with it via the inbox_client.py
and poll_client.py scripts found within the scripts directory.


WSGI
----
Django web applications can be run as a WSGI app from within an HTTP server implementation
such as Apache HTTP Server v2.2. Documentation on how to accomplish this can be found on
the Django documentation website (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/wsgi/)
or on the YETI wiki page (https://github.com/TAXIIProject/yeti/wiki/Apache-2.2-Deployment).


Administration
--------------
Administration of YETI (e.g., adding user accounts, seeing/modifying stored data, etc.) can
be accomplished via the admin interface, located at 127.0.0.1/admin. You will be asked to
enter the superuser credentials entered previously when starting YETI for the first time.
